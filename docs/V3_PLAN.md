# V3 — Custom backend + frontend, RF model actually served

Status: in progress. Scope: replace Grafana-as-primary-FE with a purpose-built
dashboard, and stop leaving the trained RF model (valve-stiction-ml) unused.

## Why

V1/V2 proved the pipeline end-to-end, but two gaps were flagged directly by
the author: (1) the trained RF model was never called anywhere in the live
system — only the classic detector (ellipse+Kano) ran; (2) Grafana can show
panels but can't do a "sticky valve" animation or the specific dashboard the
author wants for a portfolio demo. V3 addresses both.

## Target architecture

```
[Simulator] --MQTT--> [Go ingestion: window, call ML service, persist DB]
                              |  gRPC (WindowRequest/WindowResponse)
                              v
                     [Detection/ML service (Python): classic detector + RF,
                      stateless predictor, no DB access]
[Go ingestion] --> [TimescaleDB] <-- [Go backend: REST + WebSocket] --> [React/TS FE]
                                              (also serves the built FE's static files)
```

## Decisions

- **Detection service becomes a pure predictor.** `DetectionCore.detect()` no
  longer persists — it just returns a result. In gRPC mode (V1), the Go
  ingestion service persists after getting the response back, since it's the
  one with the synchronous round-trip. In Kafka mode (V2), there's no Go
  consumer downstream of Kafka, so `kafka_worker.py` keeps doing its own
  persistence after calling the same core — the shared core stays pure,
  persistence is each transport's own concern.
- **RF model shipped alongside the classic detector, not replacing it.**
  `detector.py` now also loads valve-stiction-ml's trained RF artifact and
  calls `predict_window` on every window, returning `rf_label`/
  `rf_probability` next to the existing `label`/`ellipse_index`/
  `kano_verdict`. Dashboard can show both; nothing forces picking one as "the"
  answer. Model artifact (`models/20260919_e5c9bf0/model.joblib`, ~2MB) is
  checked into this repo under `detection/model/model.joblib` — it doesn't
  exist anywhere the Docker build can otherwise reach (valve-stiction-ml
  gitignores `models/`), and 2MB is small enough to just commit.
- **ML model serving stays Python via gRPC, not ported to Go.** RF is a
  scikit-learn joblib artifact — Go can't load it without an ONNX conversion
  step (new dependency, new failure surface, unproven in this project).
  Keeping it in Python reuses the gRPC contract that's already built and
  tested; the "ML service" the author asked about is exactly the existing
  detection service, now stripped of DB responsibilities.
- **Go ingestion service gains DB writes.** Previously only the Python
  detection service touched TimescaleDB. Now `grpcPublisher.Publish` writes
  the row itself after the gRPC call returns, using `jackc/pgx`.
  `kafkaPublisher.Publish` is unaffected (V2 still persists in
  `kafka_worker.py`, see above).
- **New Go backend service (`backend/`), separate binary from ingestion.**
  Polls TimescaleDB (short interval, no new broker) for latest state, holds
  WebSocket connections, and pushes diffs. Chose polling over wiring a
  pub/sub for this because ingestion and backend are independent processes
  with no existing shared channel, and a 1s DB poll is simple, correct, and
  cheap at this data volume — not worth a new piece of infra (Redis/NATS)
  just to avoid it.
- **Same Go backend serves the built frontend's static files.** Matches the
  author's own phrasing ("go service untuk serve fe") literally: one Go
  binary serves `/api/*`, `/ws`, and the React app's static build output.
  Avoids a second web server (nginx) purely to host static files.
- **Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite**, per the original PRD's V4 plan.
  Dashboard: per-sensor status, animated sticky-valve indicator (CSS,
  driven by `label`), PV-vs-OP phase plot (the same shape the ellipse
  detector scores), PV-over-time and OP-over-time line charts. WebSocket for
  live push, matching how the animation/status needs to update itself.
- **Grafana stays.** Kept as-is for ops/debugging (ad-hoc SQL against
  TimescaleDB); the new FE is the "front door" for demos, not a replacement.

## DB schema change

`window_results` gains `rf_label TEXT`, `rf_probability DOUBLE PRECISION`
(nullable — V2's Kafka path can lag behind on rolling this out, and old rows
from before this change won't have it).

## Verified end-to-end

`docker compose up --build`: ingestion windows, calls the ML service (gRPC),
gets back both classic and RF predictions, and persists them itself —
confirmed via `docker compose logs ingestion` showing `rf_label`/
`rf_probability` alongside the classic fields. `GET /api/sensors` and
`GET /api/sensors/{id}/windows` return live data from TimescaleDB. `/ws`
sends an initial snapshot then diff-based `update` messages as new windows
land (checked directly with a WebSocket client). `/` serves the built React
app and its hashed asset bundle (`/assets/*.js`, `*.css`) with 200s.

## Finding: RF doesn't generalize to the simulator's synthetic signal

Running live against the simulator (not held-out real data), the RF model
predicts `"yes"` with high confidence (0.86–0.99) for **every** sensor,
including `valve-2` (`STICTION_ENABLED=false`), which the classic detector
correctly calls `"no"`. This isn't a plumbing bug — feature extraction goes
through the same `valve_stiction_ml.features` code the model was trained
with (per-window z-score, then tsfel), so the RF is scoring exactly the
features it was trained to score. The gap is a genuine train/serve
distribution mismatch: RF was trained on ISDB/SACAC (real industrial
process data); the simulator's scripted triangle-wave OP + stick-slip valve
model has different noise/frequency characteristics it never saw. The
classic detector generalizes here because it's a fixed geometric/pattern
rule, not fit to any particular data distribution.

Left as-is, not "fixed": retraining on simulator output would be circular
(testing a model against the same distribution it was trained on proves
nothing), and the dashboard already surfaces both labels side by side —
letting a viewer see the disagreement directly is a more honest demo than
hiding it. Worth calling out explicitly in demos/writeups as a real
lesson about synthetic-data validation, not swept under the rug.
